            <h1 class="text">About me</h1>
            <h3 class="text">I am looking for a job as a junior Java programmer.
                I am a graduate of Software Development Academy - the largest programming academy in
                Central and Eastern Europe, where I took part in the "Java from scratch" course, lasting 360 hours.
                I got to know Java there very well, relational databases such as MySql, PostgreSQL and nonrelational
                databases such as MongoDB, I learned to work with Git, I know how to use Spring and many others,
                such as Maven, Servlets, JSP, JDBC, Hibernate, design patterns. I know how to work in Scrum.
                I learned little about HTML, CSS and JS. From an early age I was interested in computer science and
                programming.
                I studied at home whenever possible. I went to high school with the "Information management" profile,
                and then I did a one-year "IT technician" school where I studied programming in "Pascal".
                Unfortunately, for personal reasons, I could not continue university education.
                I started working as a driver in a family business that provided DHL services.
                Now I am still a driver, in the meantime I obtained all driving licenses and drive a truck in Poland.
                However, thanks to this work I could afford a course at SDA and rediscover my passion for programming.
                I gained many new skills for many years. Teamwork is not strange to me.
                I want to go to the IT industry and fulfill myself, which gives me the greatest pleasure.</h3>
