        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h5>I am looking for a job as a junior Java programmer.
            I am a graduate of Software Development Academy - the largest programming academy in
            Central and Eastern Europe, where I took part in the "Java from scratch" course, lasting 360 hours.
            I got to know Java there very well, relational databases such as MySql, PostgreSQL and nonrelational
            databases such as MongoDB, I learned to work with Git, I know how to use Spring and many others,
            such as Maven, Servlets, JSP, JDBC, Hibernate, design patterns. I know how to work in Scrum.
            I learned little about HTML, CSS and JS. From an early age I was interested in computer science and
            programming.
            I studied at home whenever possible. I went to high school with the "Information management" profile,
            and then I did a one-year "IT technician" school where I studied programming in "Pascal".
            Unfortunately, for personal reasons, I could not continue university education.
            I started working as a driver in a family business that provided DHL services.
            Now I am still a driver, in the meantime I obtained all driving licenses and drive a truck in Poland.
            However, thanks to this work I could afford a course at SDA and rediscover my passion for programming.
            I gained many new skills for many years. Teamwork is not strange to me.
            I want to go to the IT industry and fulfill myself, which gives me the greatest pleasure.</h5>
