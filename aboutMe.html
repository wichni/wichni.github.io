        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h5>From an early age I was interested in computer science and programming. I studied at home whenever
            possible. I went to high school with the "Information management" profile, and then I did a one-year "IT
            technician" school where I studied programming in "Pascal". Unfortunately, for personal reasons, I could
            not continue university education. I started working as a driver in a family business that provided DHL
            services. Now I am still a driver, in the meantime I obtained all driving licenses and drive a truck in
            Poland. However, thanks to this work I could afford a course at SDA and rediscover my passion for
            programming. I gained many new skills for many years. Teamwork is not strange to me. I want to go to the
            IT industry and fulfill myself, which gives me the greatest pleasure.</h5>
